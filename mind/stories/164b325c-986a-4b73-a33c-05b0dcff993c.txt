In 2025, the FSRA was grappling with a growing concern: how to ensure the stability and resilience of the financial system in an era dominated by AI. The introduction of its new AI-driven risk management framework was a bold move. This framework wasn't just about using AI to detect anomalies but also to predict them based on historical data and current market conditions.

One key component of this initiative was the development of predictive models that could anticipate market trends with unprecedented accuracy. These models were trained on vast datasets, including economic indicators, company financials, and social media sentiment. When anomalies were detected, the system would automatically trigger alerts to human analysts, allowing them to take immediate action before any potential crisis could materialize.
